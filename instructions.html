    <h1>How to Use Your Creative Works Scrapbook App</h1>
    <p>Welcome to your creative space! This guide will help you get started with building pages and organizing them into different scrapbooks.</p>

    <div class="instruction-section">
        <h2>1. Managing Your Scrapbooks</h2>
        <p>The "My Scrapbooks" section on the left sidebar is your main hub for organizing projects. A scrapbook is simply a collection of pages.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create a New Scrapbook:</strong> To start a new project, click the <span class="highlight">Create New Scrapbook</span> button. A prompt will appear asking for a name.</li>
            <li><strong>Select a Scrapbook:</strong> The currently selected scrapbook is highlighted with a blue border. All new pages you save will be added to this specific scrapbook. Simply click on a scrapbook's name to make it the active one.</li>
            <li><strong>Delete a Scrapbook:</strong> You can delete a scrapbook and all of its pages by clicking the "Delete" button next to its name. Note that you cannot delete the last remaining scrapbook.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instruction-section">
        <h2>2. Building a Page</h2>
        <p>The "Work Area" in the center is where you build your pages. The "Graphics Library" on the right provides the images you can use.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Drag Images:</strong> To add an image to your page, simply click on an image in the "Graphics Library" and drag it over to the "Work Area".</li>
            <li><strong>Adjusting Images:</strong> Once an image is in the work area, you can click and drag it to move it. You can also resize it by dragging the corners.</li>
            <li><strong>Special Effects:</strong> Before dragging an image, you can check the "Header" or "Transparent" boxes to apply special effects.
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Header:</span> This makes the image appear on top of other images.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Transparent:</span> This makes the image semi-transparent.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Delete an Image:</strong> To remove an image from the work area, hold down the <span class="highlight">Alt key</span> on your keyboard and click on the image.</li>
            <li><strong>Page Title:</strong> Use the input box at the top of the "Work Area" to give your page a unique title before saving.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instruction-section">
        <h2>3. Saving Your Work</h2>
        <p>Saving a page adds a snapshot of your "Work Area" to your selected scrapbook.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Saving a Page:</strong> Once your page is complete, click the <span class="highlight">Save Page</span> button. A thumbnail of your page will appear in the "Pages" list under your current scrapbook.</li>
            <li><strong>Saving to the Correct Scrapbook:</strong> The page will always be saved to the scrapbook that is currently highlighted in the "My Scrapbooks" list.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessing Saved Pages:</strong> The "Pages" list displays all the pages within your currently selected scrapbook. You can scroll through this list to see all of your saved work.</li>
            <li><strong>Loading a Saved Page:</strong> Click on any page thumbnail in the list to load that page back into the "Work Area" for editing.</li>
            <li><strong>Deleting a Saved Page:</strong> To delete a page, click the "Delete" button on its thumbnail.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="instruction-section">
